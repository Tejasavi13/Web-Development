    <h1>THOUGHT OF THE DAY</h1>
    <p>Success is not merely the culmination of achieving a singular goal, but rather a journey marked by persistence, learning, and growth. It is the product of setting ambitious objectives, diligently pursuing them despite obstacles, and adapting to challenges along the way. True success is found not only in the attainment of tangible outcomes but also in the development of character, resilience, and wisdom gained through experience.</p>
    <h1>ALWAYS REMEMBER</h1>
    <p2>Don't ask lord to guide your footsteps, unless you are willing to move your feet.</p2>
